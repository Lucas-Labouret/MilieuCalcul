    \field{abstract}{%
    Efficient sampling often relies on irregular point sets that uniformly
  cover the sample space. We present a flexible and simple optimization
  strategy for such point sets. It is based on the idea of increasing the
  mutual distances by successively moving each point to the "farthest point,"
  i.e., the location that has the maximum distance from the rest of the point
  set. We present two iterative algorithms based on this strategy. The first is
  our main algorithm which distributes points in the plane. Our experimental
  results show that the resulting distributions have almost optimal blue noise
  properties and are highly suitable for image plane sampling. The second is a
  variant of the main algorithm that partitions any point set into equally
  sized subsets, each with large mutual distances; the resulting partitionings
  yield improved results in more general integration problems such as those
  occurring in physically based rendering.%
